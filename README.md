# CPE-Year-1-Projects
All of my projects for my first year as a CPE. Includes Java, JavaScript, Python, and VHDL languages.
Java projects mostly focus on Object-Oriented programming.
Python projects focus entirely on the base implementation of various data structures
JavaScript focuses on "computational art" projects, which involve rendering different images using the Processing libraries
VHDL projects focuses on learning how to design and implement basic computer architecture components, such as Muxes and Counters
